What do we want to replace...

*** Boolean:

boolean -> id0_boolean_t

*** Chars / 8-bit ints:

unsigned char -> id0_unsigned_char_t
signed char -> id0_signed_char_t

THEN

Same but with tabs

THEN

char -> id0_char_t

THEN

byte -> id0_byte_t (even though it's just an unsigned char in original code by definition...)

*** 16-bit ints:

NOT FOR NOW (see why soon)

*** 32-bit ints:

(unsigned/signed) long int -> Never mentioned in Catacomb 3-D, otherwise convert the "natural" way

THEN

unsigned long -> id0_unsigned_long_t
signed long -> id0_signed_long_t

THEN

Same but with tabs

THEN

long -> id0_long_t

THEN

longword -> id0_longword_t (even though it's just unsigned long by definition...)

*** 16-bit ints:

short -> id0_short_t (mentioned just once in Catacomb 3-D, more in Abyss)
unsigned int -> id0_unsigned_int_t (never really mentioned in Catacomb 3-D)
signed int -> Never mentioned
word -> id0_word_t (same as unsigned int in the original code)

THEN

int -> id0_int_t
unsigned -> id0_unsigned_t

*** floats and doubles??? (c3_draw.c)

Let's keep these as-is for now.

*** doubles??? (c3_draw.c)

*** Replacements of MAXINT and MININT (c3_draw.c)

BONUS (Can be manually swapped since the compiler will probably complain otherwise)

_seg -> id0_seg
far -> id0_far
huge -> id0_huge
