Submitting patches
==================

Patches may be submitted via a pull request on GitHub. Please note that
unless explicitly stated in your code, all submissions will be assumed
to be licensed under a 3-clause BSD license.

Despite this project consisting of code distributed as GPLv2+,
several pieces of code can be used with sources which may not be under
GPL compatible licenses. Additionally, the Wolfenstein 3D sources are
dual licensed under the GPLv2+ and the original source code EULA.
Given these facts, outside of specific exceptions submissions
must be made under the more liberal BSD license.

Exceptions may be allowed on a case by case basis,
and need to be clearly documented.
